# Vue Basic app 
- ugliest thing in the world, but it demonstrates how to set up a basic Vue functionality with just the CDN
- Created following Brad Traversy's crash course for 2021 
- Notable deviations
    - Brad uses the Fetch API, I converted to axios for the get request. Mostly because that's what I chose to use when got deprecated
    - I also incorporated bootstrap for some of the css, just to see if it would work. It did.
