# Flexbox

- What is Flexbox
    - One-dimensional layout method for laying out items in rows and columns
    - Newish addition to css
    - included to address common layout frustrations
    - how do we lay things out in a container?
        - used to be a nightmare
    - This allows us to scale elements to look nice no matter the size of the viewport
    - why flex?
        - allows us to distribute space dynamically across elements of an unknown size
    - 'flexible' layouts
- properties
    - to activate flexbox we have to add ```display:flex``` to the parent container
- The flex model
    - main axis defaults left to right <------------>
    - we use flex-direction to adjust how the content flows
        - ```flex-direction: row;``` this is the default, left to right on the main axis
        - ```flex-direction: row-reverse;``` this makes it go from right to left
        - ```flex-direction: column;``` default, top to bottom
            - This will also adjust the pieces to fit inside the container
        - ```flex-direction: column-reverse;``` This makes it go from bottom to top
- Justify content
    - How the content is distributed across the main axis
    - depends on flex-direction!
        - ```justify-content: flex-start;``` flex-start is the default, content starts on the left
        - ```justify-content: flex-end;``` flex-end will move it to the right
        - ```justify-content:center;``` center will center it along the main axis
        - ```justify-content:space-between;``` will put space between elements but not on the outer edge of the elements
        - ```justify-content:space-around;``` gives each element the same amount of space around it
        - ```justify-content:space-evenly;``` space the content evenly on the axis
    - The direction of the main axis is what matters. Changing that can reverse everything
- flex wrap
    - Whether the elements will wrap along the main axis onto a new line
    - ```flex-wrap: wrap;``` Will create a new column when the elements no longer fit along the cross axis
    - ```flex-wrap: wrap-reverse;``` Will reverse the wrap along the cross axis
- align-items
